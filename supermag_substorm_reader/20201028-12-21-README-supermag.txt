File contains magnetic indices derived from the magnetometer data provided
by the SuperMAG collaborators. These indices are not official indices and are
not authorized by IAGA. The official indices can be found on the World Data
Center for Geomagnetism website (http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html).

If you use the indices in publications and/or presentations please clearly
indicate that these are SuperMAG derived indices and reference appropriate
publications (see below).


Caveats:

 1)	Despite comprehensive and time-consuming data correction and validation
 	SuperMAG does not guarantee the quality of the data from the individual
 	station and thus does not guarantee the quality of the indices either.
 	The user is encouraged to validate the data before using them in
 	publications.

 2)	Indices are revised as new stations are added to the data holdings.

 3)	Finally, the indices are based on the SuperMAG version of the data and
 	thus have undergone error correction, temporal resampling, rotation,
 	and the baseline has been subtracted.  The data used are thus not
 	equivalent to the original data that can be obtained from the
 	collaborators.
